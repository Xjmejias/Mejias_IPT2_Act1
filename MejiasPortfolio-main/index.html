      <p><strong>What technologies did you use and why?</strong><br />
        I used HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript to make the
        navigation interactive. These technologies are beginner-friendly and
        important for frontend development.

      <p><strong>Which parts were easiest?</strong><br />
        Writing HTML content and basic CSS styling were the easiest parts for me like changing fonts and some interactive colors.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Which parts were most challenging?</strong><br />
        JavaScript logic, especially hiding and showing sections, was the most
        challenging for me and the funtionalites.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What technologies are you interested in learning?</strong><br />
        I want to learn more advanced JavaScript codes, HTML, and backend development.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What kind of applications do you want to build?</strong><br />
        I want to build useful websites and mobile game applications such as  personal
        systems, sports-related apps, and simple business websites.
